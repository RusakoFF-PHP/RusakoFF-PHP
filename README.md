🌱 I'm a beginner PHP developer with experience in web development freelancing platforms. Currently diving deep into PHP and object-oriented programming. I've completed several pet projects to practice my skills and explore various aspects of the language. <br>
<br>
🔭 My current projects include simple web applications I've built to learn about databases and basic user interaction. I'm committed to continually improving my knowledge and skills in web development.<br>
<br>
💬 On this GitHub page, I'll be sharing my projects, experiences, and learning resources. I'm open to feedback and advice from the developer community!
